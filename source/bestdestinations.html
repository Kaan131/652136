            <h3>1. Aruba</h3> <!-- Article 1: -->
            <p>
			The Dutch Caribbean island of Aruba takes the No. 1 spot on the list of top Caribbean destinations for 2020. 
			The island paradise, which locals and tourists alike have deemed “One Happy Island,” 
			embodies everything you’re looking for out of Caribbean tropical vacation spots.
			The locals are some of the friendliest people in all of the Caribbean, everybody speaks English, 
			and the resorts and hotels are designed to meet the needs of any kind of traveller. 
			Eagle Beach is consistently ranked as one of the most beautiful beaches in the Caribbean, 
			but Druif Beach and Palm Beach are also equally stunning.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Cuba</h3> <!-- Article 2: -->
            <p>
            Tourism in Cuba has surged ever since it re-established its relationship with the American government in 2015. 
			Even though Canadians and Europeans have been long-time fans and frequent visitors to the island, 
			Americans are just beginning to discover the charm of one of the world’s most well-preserved cultures.
			Cuba is also one of the most affordable beach vacations for travellers from North and South America. 
			From the historical streets of Havana and the country’s rich cultural heritage to some of the most remarkable beaches in the Caribbean, 
			you have to head to Cuba to enjoy this paradise for yourself.

            <h3>3. Barbados</h3> <!-- Article 3: -->
            <p>
            What’s not to love about stunning coral reefs, chilled vibes, and pink and white-sand beaches? Barbados is developing so rapidly that it’s become one of the hottest Caribbean destinations in recent years.
			Famous for the picture-perfect beaches, travel experts predict that Barbados is going to become more popular next year due to an increase in interest of culture, nightlife, and scenery. 
			From the Unesco World Heritage-listed capital to the thumping nightlife and energetic festivals, 
			there’s not much that Barbados doesn’t have to offer travellers. We suggest that you try to find flights now, 
			as prices increase during the spring months.

            <h3>4. St. Lucia</h3> <!-- Article 4: -->
            <p>
            Looking for places to go for an anniversary? St. Lucia has recently earned the top spot in the Caribbean for couples looking for romantic beaches and all-inclusive, 
			secluded hotels. The variety of activities available for couples here is what makes it one of the best Caribbean destinations, we think.
			Fly above St. Lucia and you’ll immediately be taken aback by how diverse the coastline is. From remote fishing villages and impressive reef-diving resorts to volcanic beaches and luxury resorts, 
			there’s something here for everybody, even if you’re travelling alone.

            <h3>5. Curacao</h3> <!-- Article 5: -->
            <p> 
			Curacao is just a short plane ride away from Aruba, which means you can find flights for less than $100 if you want to hop between the two islands. However, 
			there’s so much to do on Curacao that we don’t think you’ll ever want to leave.
			Similar to Aruba, Curacao is a Dutch Caribbean island, most famous for the iconic multi-coloured Dutch houses that line the island’s main port. 
			Here, you can enjoy perfect weather pretty much year-round, excellent diving, and stunning desert flora and fauna.

            <h3>6. St. Kitts</h3> <!-- Article 6: -->
            <p>
            The lush, dramatic coastline of St. Kitts makes it feel more like you’re visiting some tropical island in Asia or even Hawaii. 
			In fact, the Mount Liamuiga hike is one of the best volcano hikes in the entire Caribbean.
			The dense rainforests and a unique black-sand beach make St. Kitts truly special when compared to other top Caribbean destinations. 
			However, what we truly love about this island, and what’s going to propel it to super-stardom in 2020, are the vibes. 
			Exploring here feels like you’re exploring a remote area of Neverland, and that’s hard to come across in the tourist-saturated Caribbean region.
